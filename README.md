# NexThings IoT Core

It was a bit hard to define the idea at the beginning, but this is essentially one in
many repositories to come, all to build one multi-protocol IoT platform.

## What the project is
I aim at building a multi-protocol IoT Platform that anyone can just clone and run.

## Features I am at building
```
. Message Streaming from different protocols eg MQTT, WS, LoRa etc
. CommandLine Access
. Customizable Analytics dashboards
. Customizable Alerts
. Custom Commands
. Reply Scripts
