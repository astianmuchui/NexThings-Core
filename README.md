# Foreword
It was a bit hard to define the idea at the beginning, but this project fundamentally became about
curiosity, the curiosity to build something different, think different, work something long-term, to see what it takes.
And thus how we arrived here.

# NexThings IoT Core

NexThings IoT Core is the foundation of a modular, multi-protocol IoT platform designed for scalability, flexibility, and real-time insights.
